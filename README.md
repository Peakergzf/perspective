## Inspiration
While it is agreed that one of the best modes of learning is through teaching, this is rarely tapped upon. The best environment that exists for peer-to-peer engagement are weekly tutorials, but this is limited by three main factors 1) not all tutorials are discussion-oriented, 2) time is limited every week for such interactions to take place, and 3) teaching groups are small and static accross the weeks. One online alternative is the unit discussion forums, yet the interactions there are often question-based, and don't encourage teaching as a form of learning.

## What it does
Perspective is a video learning website where the content creators are students. Students upload videos of themselves teaching different topics within a unit, soliciting feedback from their peers through this exercise. Watchers of these videos benefit from another student's summarised perspective on the same content, instead of relying solely on the lecturer's. We envision a future where a video which has garnered enough validation from other students taking the same unit may rise to a more general stream of faculty or university-level, allowing for cross-disciplinary sharing of knowledge and ideas!
